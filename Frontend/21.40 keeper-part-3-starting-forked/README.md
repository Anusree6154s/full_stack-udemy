# Explanation

1. **`App.js`**:
   - The `App` component is the top-level component.
   - It uses the `useState` hook to manage a state variable called `items`, which is an array that stores the notes added by the user.
   - It renders the `Header`, `CreateArea`, `Note`, and `Footer` components.
   - The `CreateArea` component is used to add new notes, and it passes the `addItem` function to add notes to the `items` array.
   - The `Note` component is used to display notes, and it passes the `items` array and the `addItem` function to manage notes.
   - The `Footer` component displays a copyright notice.

2. **`CreateArea.js`**:
   - The `CreateArea` component is responsible for creating new notes.
   - It uses local state to manage the `text` object, which contains `title` and `content`.
   - The `changeValue` function updates the `text` state as the user types in the input fields.
   - The `addText` function is called when the user clicks the "Add" button to add a new note. It calls the `addItem` function passed as a prop from the parent component (`App.js`).
   - The input fields are cleared after adding a note.

3. **`Note.js`**:
   - The `Note` component is responsible for displaying the list of notes.
   - It maps through the `items` array and renders individual notes.
   - The `deleteItem` function is used to delete a note. It filters out the item with the provided index and updates the `items` array.
   - The "DELETE" button is used to trigger the `deleteItem` function for the respective note.

4. **`Header.js`**:
   - The `Header` component displays the header of the application with the title "Keeper."

5. **`Footer.js`**:
   - The `Footer` component displays a footer with a copyright notice, including the current year.

In summary, this React application allows users to create and delete notes. The `App` component manages the state of the notes and passes data and functions down to child components for rendering and interaction. The `CreateArea` component handles note creation, while the `Note` component displays individual notes and provides the functionality to delete them. The `Header` and `Footer` components provide the header and footer of the application.
