# Explanation
Here's a breakdown of what's happening in the code:

1. **`App.js`**:
   - This is the main component of the application.
   - It renders the `Header`, `CreateArea`, a list of `Note` components, and the `Footer`.
   - It manages the state of `notes` using the `useState` hook. The `notes` state is an array that stores the notes added by the user.
   - The `addNote` function is used to add a new note to the `notes` array.
   - The `deleteNote` function is used to delete a note from the `notes` array.

2. **`CreateArea.js`**:
   - This component is responsible for creating new notes.
   - It uses local state to manage the `note` object, which contains `title` and `content`.
   - The `handleChange` function updates the `note` state when the user types in the input fields.
   - The `submitNote` function is called when the user clicks the "Add" button to add a new note. It calls the `onAdd` function passed as a prop from the parent component (in this case, `App.js`).
   - The `expand` function is called when the user clicks in the textarea, which expands the textarea to allow for more content.

3. **`Header.js`**:
   - This component displays the header of the application, which includes the title "Keeper."

4. **`Footer.js`**:
   - This component displays the footer of the application, which includes a copyright notice with the current year.

5. **`Note.js`**:
   - This component represents an individual note.
   - It displays the `title` and `content` of the note.
   - It provides a delete button that, when clicked, calls the `onDelete` function passed as a prop from the parent component (`App.js`) to delete the note.

In summary, this React application allows users to create, view, and delete notes. The `App` component manages the state of the notes and passes data and functions down to child components for rendering and interaction. The `CreateArea` component handles note creation, while the `Note` component represents individual notes. The `Header` and `Footer` components provide the header and footer of the application. The application utilizes Material-UI icons for a better visual experience.

# Updations 
1. uses Material-UI for styling and icons.
2. the delete functionality is implemented within the Note component using mui
3. provides an expandable text area in the CreateArea component for creating notes.
4. uses a Material-UI Fab (Floating Action Button) with an "Add" icon to add new notes.
