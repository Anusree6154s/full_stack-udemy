## Instructions from Angela

**IMPORTANT:** You should not need to make ANY CHANGES to index.html. All code should be written in your CSS file.

1. Create a CSS file and incorporate it as an external stylesheet.
2. Use CSS to style each of the color titles to meaning. 
   - Hint: Use the id to help if you don't know the words in Spanish.
3. Use CSS to change all the color titles to have "font-weight: normal."
4. Use CSS (not HTML) to make all the images 200px in height and 200px in width. 
   - Hint: 
     - [height](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height)
     - [width](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width)

The HTML page displays the names of colors in Spanish with their corresponding images. The TODOs provided indicate the tasks that need to be accomplished in the CSS file to style the page according to the given instructions.
